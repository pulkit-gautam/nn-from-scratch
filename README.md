# nn-from-scratch

This project implements a fully customizable neural network framework in Python, built from scratch using NumPy. It supports flexible configuration, allowing users to adjust key network parameters such as the number of layers, neurons, batch size, learning rate, and activation functions. The framework includes auto-differentiation for efficient backpropagation and offers multiple optimizers, including Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Momentum, and Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG). This tool is ideal for experimenting with different neural network architectures and training settings to explore deep learning concepts.

## Installation
